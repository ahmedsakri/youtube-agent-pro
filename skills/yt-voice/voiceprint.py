"""voiceprint.py - read your own transcripts and measure how you actually talk.

    python3 voiceprint.py best-video.txt
    python3 voiceprint.py vid1.srt vid2.srt vid3.txt      # merge several, the more the better
    python3 voiceprint.py *.txt --json

Point it at the transcripts of your best videos (not your scripts - the words you actually said) and
it measures the things a voice.md should capture but that you cannot see about yourself: your mean
sentence length, your filler rate, the distinctive words you lean on, and the hype words to flag.
It does not write your voice.md - it gives /yt-voice the measurements to write it from.

  SENTENCE LENGTH   short and punchy, or long and winding. A script that fights this is unreadable
                    out loud.
  FILLER RATE       how much "like / basically / literally / you know" you run - fine to keep some,
                    useful to know the baseline.
  SIGNATURE WORDS   content words you use far more than normal speech would. These are your tics.
                    Keep them; they are what makes a script sound like you and not like a blog.
  HYPE WORDS        "insane / crazy / game-changer" you already say - decide which stay and which
                    go in the banned list.

IT MEASURES, IT DOES NOT JUDGE. A long mean sentence is not worse than a short one. A high filler
rate is not a grade. This is a mirror, so the script a skill writes you is readable on the first
take instead of the fourth.
